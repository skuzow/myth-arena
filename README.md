## Applied Methodologies

We have applied different methodologies during the project like, SCRUM to organize work with [JIRA](https://myth-arena.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MYT/boards/1/roadmap) tool in this case, and about technical aspect, we have been using [gitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow for organizing branches and commits in general.
